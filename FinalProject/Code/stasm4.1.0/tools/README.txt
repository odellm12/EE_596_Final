tools/README.txt
----------------

The tools directory contains miscellaneous tools used in the Stasm project.
It also contains prebuilt Stasm executables.

The files mv.exe, rm.exe, egrep.exe, etc. are Windows ports of the
standard UNIX programs.  They are smart enough to recognize
back- and forward-slashes in directory names.
